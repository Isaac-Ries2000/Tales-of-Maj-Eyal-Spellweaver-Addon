Hopefully, wherever you are, this will find you. We enchanted it with a special spell to make it teleport to specifically you, but we do not know where you are, or how you are doing. As you know, we have long been considering who should recieve the Beacon next. Together, we Spellweavers decided that, even if you are not here with us, hopefully, this will help you find home again. You were already a candidate, and seeing the amount of support into sending this to help you made us decide that this is what we need to do.

Of course, here is the official story of the Beacon of the Spellweavers, since we cannot recite it to you as the traditions demands:
Long ago, in the time of the first Spellweavers, one of the enchanters of Wovenhome carved this simple wooden staff. Although they only enchanted it with a weak enchantment, they passed it down to one of their favorite students. That apprentice further enchanted the staff, and of course, passed it down to one of their students. Over and over again, we passed it down, enchanting it further and further. Now you hold it. This staff represents what it means to be a Spellweaver. It may be powerful, but also let it remind you that knowledge is to be used for good, that power must be complemented with mercy, and that even one with power like you cannot exist without others, both past and present.

Best of luck, %s:
Head Professor Hundredeyes, Professors Ifnai, Paradise, and Arbus, and Spellweavers Grath, Iron, Dymion, and Faller.

Hopefully, wherever you are, this will find you. We enchanted it with a special spell to make it teleport to you, but it is tricky magic. We have been considering who to pass the Beacon to for a long time, but after you returned, everyone's joy in your return made it easy to decide. We were not able to help you when you were lost, but now that we can, we have decided to support your mission. Just please come back once you are done, and don't forget what it means to be a Spellweaver.
