18th of Revenge: After our scout reported some strange ruin hidden away in these mountains, we have started exploring. There was a magical barrier and warning in the front, but we should be able to dispel it easily. The Geomancer's orders said to seize any advantage we could find against the Sunwall and the other Prides, regardless of risks, so we must continue.

19th of Revenge: The barrier is down. There seem to be a large amount of hostile elementals, but we've been able to manage so far. Unfortunately, we are unable to proceed forward, as our best mages are simply too busy keeping the elementals at bay.

20th of Revenge: We should have heeded the warning. The elementals are only getting more frequent. We're holding out still, but we may need to retreat.

21st of Revenge: We have taken heavy losses. We have no choice but to retreat. Hopefully, I can report it to the Geomancer, but we need to

To all researchers, on this 24th of Dearth:
The Grand Geomancer and the other members of our Pride have been putting even more pressure on us to research offensive instead of defensive magic. We need to come up with something powerful, and soon. If we cannot, this facility will certainly be shut down, and I doubt any of us will find much luck elsewhere as the "useless cowards" the Geomancer describes us as. Wralbek has sent Virkud to the Spellweavers and Uridak to those necromancers as spies, in the hopes that we can find something fast. Also, apparently Virkud will be going by "Adt'dree'at" to stay in character or something, so don't ask if it comes up...

Until we find anything, we need everyone to do their absolute best work at all times. All of our research and goals depends on this.

Virkud, or Adt'dree'at now, managed to get some kind of design notes for a "Harmonic Elemental" from the Spellweavers. Although Adt'dree'at's idiosyncrasies worried me, I have to admit, I see why they have been considered as such a competent spy. These plans are really something. If we can create them, this will prove the value of our research to the Geomancer. However, they seem unduely worried about the "stealing" from the Spellweavers. As such, I have reassigned them to helping read the plans, along with Wirut and Kardot. Clearly working too long with those Spellweavers is bad for morale...

Harmonic Elemental:
This construct should be capable of nullifying magical, natural, and physical damage in a large area. In other words, it should be able to protect any area and all of its inhabitants. Beyond that, it should function like any other well-designed magical construct, able to be easily controlled and not spontaneously gain sentience or any such thing (ignore the previous project, that was a fluke). To facilitate this, when it is being conjured, the castors must calm their emotions and focus on -

Something has gone wrong in creating the construct. The moment it was even moderately stable, it suddenly began destroying everything in sight. Even our strongest mages were unable to harm it, as it somehow just ignored nearly every spell cast against it. We have tried to place it in stasis, but I cannot be sure that it will hold long, and even in stasis, it is releasing smaller elementals. Thankfully, they have a fraction of the power, but I am still ordering an evacuation. We will go to the surface, then magically seal the entrance so that nothing can ever escape. This thing cannot be allowed to reach the surface. 

However... we cannot let the Geomancer know about this. If this is the outcome of trying to create this horrible construct, I cannot let others try it, for our future. I know that the plans were edited by one of the researchers, but there is no way that other orcs would not try the same.

Unfortunately, I doubt the Pride will have much positive news for researchers who "accidentally" ruined a facility and had to abandon it totally. Adt'dree'at claims that we may be able to find a place to stay with the Spellweavers. I doubt that they'll take in us, especially since we were literally spying on them, but I see no other options. I have ensured that Wirut will be coming with us, and Uridak, Kardot, and Rankrit all agreed to come with as well. I will be briefly stopping by our Pride to ensure that they think we died in some form of foolish mistake so that nobody comes looking for anything here, but I should be able to meet up with the others quickly after I promptly get exiled by the Geomancer. I should be able to fake my death if he decides to have me executed instead, so this should work out.

This disaster is my fault. I knew the Geomancer wanted more combat-oriented magic, and I did not want my friends to lose their positions. I edited the plans to make them a little more combative, but it seems to have rendered the construct entirely unstable.

I told Wralbek, who decided to spare me. He seemed even somewhat unsurprised. I... was told that I would be accompanying the survivors of our researchers to the Spellweavers. I do not understand what the plan is here, but... I will follow them. I can hardly abandon the others now, after my mistakes led them to here.

The tiny core of the elemental flickers with magical energy. Perhaps some day, it can be made into something beautiful instead of something destructive. Holding it, you can almost feel its creators' original desire to protect.

... perhaps Professor Paradise would be better suited to taking care of this?
