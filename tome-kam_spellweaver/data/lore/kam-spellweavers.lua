Lecture on the History and Purpose of the Spellweavers, given by Professor Lekkia (Professor of History and Historical Spellweaving Techniques)
#{italic}#Recorded by Lorekeeper Adt'dree'at, with the assistance of Lorekeeper Wralbek, Age of Weaving 200#{normal}#
Professor Lekkia: On this day, two hundred years ago, the original Spellweavers formed here and created Wovenhome, along with Professor Paradise, who chose not to give a lecture today. Today, we wanted to give a talk, not just about the history of us Spellweavers, but about what it means to be a part of Wovenhome.

We do not really know much about the original Spellweavers. About thirty of them came together to build Wovenhome and started teaching, but they did not write down their names, or try to set themselves up as special people. Although this means we do not have as many historical records from then, we respect those Spellweavers for choosing not to place themselves about what matters.

The most important thing we can impart to you as teachers is not just our history, but what it teaches us, and what our predecessors have to teach us. We need to value education, community, and other people over glory or power. We do not know much about the original Spellweavers, but through Professor Paradise, we know that they taught everyone who came here and did not seek to use Spellwoven techniques to hurt others. We know that they taught people for no cost other than doing some work to help maintain Wovenhome. We know that they want us to value knowledge, but to use it to help people, not just to hoard it like pointless treasures.

So, to everyone in attendance today, remember this. We Spellweavers have a duty to care about people and to teach them. The original Spellweavers taught us this, and if we forget this, then there is not even a point to Spellweaving.

Lecture on Spellweaving Theory, given by Professor Michael (Professor of Theoretical Spellweaving Techniques)
#{italic}#Translated and recorded by Lorekeeper Malem, Age of Weaving 352#{normal}#
Professor Malem: Spellweaving is an interesting thing. All of us have seen the power wielded by the Anorithils and Sun Paladins of the Gates of Morning, as well as Archmages like the orcs of the Vor Pride. Those of the Sunwall gain power by connecting with the Sun and Moons. Meanwhile, Archmages claim to draw power by using knowledge to draw on the threads of elemental power, plucking them to draw the force of the elements directly into this world.

Meanwhile, we can see similar in other sources of power. Wilders connect with Eyal itself so that Eyal may grant them power. Many theorise this also involves connecting to elemental threads, but through Eyal, instead of directly. At the same time, we see Psionics, those who, through sheer willpower, are able to alter reality and achieve incredible feats. Even some warriors and engineers are known to tap into some of the same power. If you've never seen a warrior destroy arrows lobbed at them sheerly by shouting, you may not think this, but warriors somehow access impossible power through strength and their own kind of willpower.

All of these things have one thing in common. Through intellect, willpower, strength, and the sheer desire to act, people can connect to powers greater than themselves. Spellweaving, in the end, is no different. Nearly all of us cannot access sheer magical power the way Archmages do. Most of us choose not to form a bond with nature. Next to none of us have the sheer willpower or strength required to bend reality. But what we do have is the desire to learn, to understand that which makes this world work and use it to make things better.

Spellweaving, simply put, works by connecting with the threads of the elements through a mix of willpower, understanding of the arcane, and calm clarity, and using it to weave the threads of the elements to produce effects that, while perhaps less powerful than others, are perfectly controlled. That is why no Spellwoven spell will ever go astray and harm yourself or your friends, why a trained Spellweaver will never end up in an unexpected place while Spellweaving. We try to weave the threads to access power to make things better, and we can and will do amazing things with it.

So, students, if there is one thing that you can take away from this lecture, let it be this. Spellweaving is about patiently and clearly connecting with the powers that all of us on Eyal tap into and weaving them, slowly and carefully, to produce precise, specific results. Never forget this, and you can truly understand what Spellweaving is, and what a Spellweaver does.

Lecture on the Weaver's Calendar, given by Professors Tracy and Letis (Professors of Protective Spellweaving)
#{italic}#Translated and recorded by Lorekeeper Malem, Age of Weaving 386#{normal}#
Professor Tracy: Hello students. Today I will be explaining the Weaver's Calendar, since Professor Famim is sick. Letis isn't feeling like talking today, so I'll be translating as necessary.

For a brief recap, the Weaver's Calendar has 10 months, each representing one of the ten common elements of Spellweaving, as well as the two days of balance split across the year, Harmony and Paradise, when the two moons are at equal, as well as the three days in which Summertide is at peak and the two days in which Wintertide is at peak. I feel like it is unnecessary to go into the exact details of the month orders, since you should all know those. The Age we use is of course the Age of Weaving, representing when we Spellweavers founded Wovenhome. For an example, today is the thirty-seventh of Luminous, Age of Weaving 386.

Oh... what's that? Professor Letis just reminded me to tell you that the Gates of Morning use a different calendar system than us. This is correct, although since they rarely mark dates on documents, only those of us who work with them directly have much of an understanding of how the Sunwall's system works. We actually created our calendar to aid in scheduling teaching because the previous calendar was apparently very inconvenient for us, although we have relatively few notes about that system.

One important thing to remember about the Weaver's Calendar is that it was fundamentally created to help organize teaching schedules. For the most part, the months were just chosen for seasonally appropriate elements. Cold and Dark are during the colder season, Light and Fire in warmer, and Lightning, due to its association with storms, in the more stormy, rainy season. It was created by a Professor Loran along with a group of other Professors about six hundred years ago. Some new Spellweavers assume that magic is affected by the elements of the months, but really it's just an organizational method.

Oh, right. Professor Letis says the exceptions to that are Summertide, Wintertide, Harmony, and Paradise. All of them have been known to affect magic. There are stories of people trapping the light of the moons in phials to create strange and mystical lights during Summertide and Wintertide. Additionally, we have heard stories of people disappearing during Harmony and Paradise, although given the lack of any kind of proof, the current belief among most is just that those are just legends. It can be awfully dark during those times, so people probably got lost. Many Spellweavers actually view those times as fortunate, since they represent balance in a certain sense.

Now, before we leave, Professor Famim said that you will have a test on the Weaver's Calendar next week, so make sure to read the text on the creators to be prepared.

Address to the students of Wovenhome regarding the Orcs who have come here for asylum, given by Professor Hundredeyes (Professor of Necromancy and Applied Informational Advantages)
#{italic}#Translated and recorded by Professor Ifnai, Age of Weaving 570#{normal}#
Professor Hundredeyes: Students of Wovenhome. As you know, we have recently had a large group of orcs request permission to stay here, following a horrible... event, within the Orcish Prides. The leader of these orcs, Grath, has requested that I not explain to you the exact details, but suffice to say, it is truly nightmarish.

Regardless, following the recent discussion on how to respond, we have decided to allow these orcs safe haven here. As our predecessors accepted magical arts like necromancy that some fear, leading to more knowledge and safety for those who might be shunned elsewhere, we will accept these orcs as part of our community so that they can be safe and we can all live peacefully.

I know tensions are high, but honestly, these orcs literally had nowhere to go, since their prides became unsafe, and the Sunwall would never consider anything involving actually treating orcs well or trying to make peace. I need you all to really try to make these new members of our community feel welcome. I know that this really isn't going to be an easy transition for anyone, but we need to make this work.
 
To that end, if I hear about anyone mistreating our new students and guests, the perpetrators will be getting detention, at minimum, and worse if need be. We're all in this together and we're all going to be a part of this community, so I need you all to try to make it work. If any of our new community members try to bother you, please talk to Grath or any of us Professors. Grath will be representing the orcs until everything is settled.

... also, please nobody tell Aeryn or anyone from the Sunwall about this. Our relationship is already a little strained, and this really wouldn't help...
